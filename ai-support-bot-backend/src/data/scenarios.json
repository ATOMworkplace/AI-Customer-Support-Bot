      { "question": "Can I customize or modify my watch?", "answer": "Factory customization programs exist for certain marques. Aftermarket modifications typically diminish value and void warranties. We recommend consulting our specialists before any alterations." },
      { "question": "What's the best watch for investment?", "answer": "While we cannot provide investment advice, historically, limited editions from prestigious manufacturers with exceptional complications and provenance tend to appreciate. Passion should precede profit in collecting." },
      { "question": "Do you ship internationally?", "answer": "Yes, we arrange secure international delivery through specialized couriers with comprehensive insurance. Import duties and taxes are the recipient's responsibility, though we provide documentation assistance." },
      { "question": "What's included with my purchase?", "answer": "Your timepiece arrives with its original box, papers, warranty cards, instruction manual, and a certificate of authenticity from Horologie Excellence. Additional accessories vary by manufacturer." },
      { "question": "Can I reserve a watch online?", "answer": "Certainly. A deposit secures your selection for 48 hours, allowing time for arrangement of payment and delivery. Full terms are outlined during the reservation process." },

      { "question": "What's a chronometer certification?", "answer": "Chronometer status is awarded by COSC after 15 days of testing under various positions and temperatures, certifying precision within -4/+6 seconds daily—a hallmark of superior mechanical performance." },
      { "question": "Can women wear men's watches?", "answer": "Absolutely. Contemporary styling transcends traditional gender boundaries. We guide clients toward proportions and aesthetics that complement personal style, regardless of conventional categorization." },
      { "question": "What's the smallest/largest watch you carry?", "answer": "Our collection ranges from elegant 28mm ladies' complications to bold 44mm sports chronographs. We assist in selecting proportions that harmonize with wrist size and personal preference." },
      { "question": "How do moon phase complications work?", "answer": "A moon phase display tracks the lunar cycle through a disk rotating beneath an aperture, completing one revolution every 29.5 days. High-quality mechanisms deviate only one day per 122 years." },
      { "question": "What's a perpetual calendar?", "answer": "This masterful complication automatically accounts for varying month lengths and leap years, requiring adjustment only once per century. It represents horological sophistication at its zenith." },

      { "question": "What's the difference between sapphire and mineral crystal?", "answer": "Sapphire crystal, second only to diamond in hardness, resists scratching exceptionally. Mineral glass is more affordable but vulnerable to abrasion. All our timepieces feature sapphire for enduring clarity." },
      { "question": "Can scratches be removed from my watch?", "answer": "Our artisans perform case and bracelet refinishing to restore original brushed or polished surfaces. Deep scratches may require more extensive intervention. We evaluate each timepiece individually." },

      { "question": "What metals are your watches made from?", "answer": "Our collection features stainless steel, 18k gold (yellow, white, and rose), platinum, and titanium. Each material offers distinct aesthetics, weight characteristics, and aging properties." },
      { "question": "What's the difference between polished and brushed finishes?", "answer": "Polished surfaces reflect light dramatically with mirror-like brilliance. Brushed finishes offer subtle sophistication with directional grain, concealing minor wear better. Many cases combine both for visual contrast." },
      { "question": "Can I get insurance for my watch?", "answer": "We strongly recommend specialized timepiece insurance. We provide detailed purchase documentation and appraisals necessary for comprehensive coverage against loss, theft, and damage." },

      { "question": "Can I negotiate the price?", "answer": "Our pricing reflects fair market value, manufacturer relationships, and our commitment to authenticity. While we occasionally offer promotional opportunities, significant discounting undermines the luxury experience we cultivate." },
      { "question": "Do you offer layaway?", "answer": "We can arrange extended payment plans for substantial acquisitions. Our client services team structures terms accommodating your timeline while securing your desired timepiece." },
      { "question": "What's the waiting list situation for popular models?", "answer": "Certain iconic pieces have extensive waiting lists due to limited production. We leverage our manufacturer relationships to minimize wait times for our established clients." },

      { "question": "Someone offered me a 'gray market' watch. Should I buy it?", "answer": "Gray market timepieces lack authorized dealer support and may have warranty complications. We cannot authenticate external purchases. Authorized acquisition ensures authenticity, warranty coverage, and manufacturer relationship." },
      { "question": "I received a counterfeit watch. Can you help identify it?", "answer": "Counterfeit timepieces represent serious concerns requiring expert examination. Please bring the piece to our boutique where our specialists conduct thorough authentication and advise on appropriate actions." },
      { "question": "The crown on my watch won't screw down properly.", "answer": "This requires immediate professional attention to prevent water damage. Please discontinue wear and contact us to arrange urgent service. This situation necessitates expert intervention." },
      { "question": "My watch fell and now runs erratically.", "answer": "Impact damage can affect timekeeping and internal components. This requires comprehensive evaluation by our master watchmakers. Please escalate to our service department immediately for diagnosis." },
      { "question": "I want to sell my entire collection.", "answer": "We facilitate significant collection acquisitions through our private client services. This discussion merits personal attention from our senior specialists. Let me connect you immediately with our acquisitions director." }
